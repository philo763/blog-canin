Check out how I managed to install `Ceph` on a cluster of Raspberry Pi's.

# Context

This project was a university project (Class - *SR05*) where we had to conduct a research about the state of the art of the famous Distributed File System (or DFS) [*CEPH*](https://ceph.com/) made by [*RedHat*](https://www.redhat.com/en). We were a team of 8 students working on that research : xxx, yyy.

# Goal

The goal of this research was to get familiar with *searching through documentation* and up-to-date software architecture such as [CEPH](https://gitlab.utc.fr/hvergnol/SR03_mini_projet/raw/master/assets/reno1.png).
We had to tackle the following areas :

* Algorithms used
* Software Architecture
* xxx
* Benchmarking

As part of the team, I was in charge of the Benchmarking part. And we chose to experiment it on *Raspberry Pi*'s.

# Results

We came up with a study paper written in *LaTeX* in English that you can read with the following link :

We also made a 20 min standalone presentation about our results in French. You can find it at the following link :
