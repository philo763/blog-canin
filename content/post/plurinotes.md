<!--more-->

# Context

As a university project, we had to form a team of 3 people : Lloyd Eric, Nguyen Minh and myself. The goal of this project was to develop an application called *PluriNotes* and to learn the basics of *OOP* (Object Oriented Programming).

# The goal

The goal of `Pluritnotes` was to provide an application written in *C++* capable of editing and managing an ensemble of notes (or memos) that may have been either text or images.


# Functionalities

* Manage a text note : Create - Edit - Delete.
* Manage an image note : Create - Edit - Delete.
* Backup all notes as your close the program.
* Load all backed up notes as you run the program.
* Archive note.
* ...

# Technical Functionalities

* Use of multiple design pattern :
  * Iterator
  * Singleton
  * Factory
  * Decorator
  * ...
* Use of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) for creating the graphical user interface.

# UML Model

Here is a picture of the UML model we used to develop our app.
