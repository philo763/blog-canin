Check out `Reno`, a car configurator written in *J2E* using a *REST API*.

<!--more-->

# Context

`Reno` was built during a university project (Class - *SR03*). Arthur N. and myself were working on this project. `Reno` is a reference to *Renault*, the French car constructor.

# Goal

The goal of this project was to develop an application using the following technologies; *J2E*, *REST API* and to learn the basics of **web programming**.

# Architecture

This is a high-level picture of the architecture that we used to build `Reno`.
